== Introduction and Goals
WIQ is the project of the current course of the Software Architecture course, which will be developed by the ES2B team composed by:

* Raymond Debasa Peralta
* Coral Izquierdo Muñiz
* Carlos Sánchez Rodríguez
* Pablo Fernando Urones Clavera

It consists of an application in which users can register and enter to play the quiz game.

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview

.Requisitos de alto nivel
* The system will have at least one web frontend deployed and access will be through the Web.
* Users will be able to register in the system and consult the history of their participation in the system: number of games, number of correct/failed questions, times, etc.
* Questions will be automatically generated from Wikidata data.
* Questions must be answered within a given time limit.
* Each question will have one correct answer and several incorrect or distracting answers. Both the correct and incorrect answers will be generated automatically.
* The system will allow access to user information through an API.
* The system will allow access to the information of the questions generated through an API.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Goals|Details
| _Privacity_ | _The data of registered users will be saved, ensuring their security_ 
| _Usability_ | _The use of the application must be an intuitive and simple process for the client user_
| _Maintainability_ | _We will try to take care of the architecture of the application so that functionality can be added, modified or removed with as few changes as possible_
| _Testeability_| _Our application may also be testable, that is, it will be subjected to a series of unit tests that we will perform to ensure proper operation of the system, in addition to identifying small errors and being able to correct them in such a case_
|===

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| _Client_ | _RTVE_ | _An application that emulates a quiz show and meets the requirements of section 1.1_
| _Contrated Company_ | _HappySw_ | _Generic software development_
| _Development Staff_ | _Raymond Debasa Peralta, Coral Izquierdo Muñiz, Carlos Sánchez Rodríguez and Pablo Fernando Urones Clavera_ | _Successfully develop the application based on the documentation in a way that reflects the architectural knowledge acquired_
| _Users_ | _Future users of the application_ | _A usable and simple application that allows them to play quiz games_
