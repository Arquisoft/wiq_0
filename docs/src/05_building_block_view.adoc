== Building Block View

=== Level 1 

==== Motivation

*_WIQ_* application is the general structure of a system in which users will have the possibility to play a game like _Saber y Ganar_ and compare their results with their friends. 

==== Contained building blocks

[options="header",cols="1,2"] 
|=== 

| Name | Description

| *_User_*
| Client of the application which will interact with it. 

| *_WIQ_*
| System developed to be used by the users.

| *_WIKIDATA_*
| Aplication to generate the questions and answers.

|=== 

=== Level 2

==== Motivation

Shows how the application will work internally. 

==== Contained building blocks

[options="header",cols="1,2"] 
|=== 

| Name | Description

| *_User Interface_*
| The user will interact with the UI.

| *_Microservices_*
| 

| *_Data Access_*
| MongoDB is the selected...

|=== 

=== Level 3

==== Motivation

Detailed structure of the system. Focused on the components of the _User Interface_ and _Data Access_. 

==== Contained Building Blocks

[options="header",cols="1,5"]
|=== 

| Name | Description   

| *_Webapp_*  
| Sections of the application where the user is going to interact with the system. 

| *_Home_* 
| Initial screen of the application. A welcome message is going to be displayed as well as the login and sign up options. 

| *_Game_* 
| Game screen where the user can play the game.

| *_Ranking_* 
| It contains the best scores recorded in the game, including the user's highest score and the scores of other users belonging to their group.

| *_History_* 
| Contains all user participations with the number of games played, correct/incorrect answers, and times.

| *_About_*
| Contains important information about the project, like the development method, the developers and how to contact them.

| *_Sign-up_* 
| Allows the client to create a new account for the application. This process can only be done once per user. 

| *_Log-in_* 
| Here the user will log-in into their personal account. In case they have created one previously. 

| *_Log-out_* 
| It logs out the user from the application.

.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

_**<Overview Diagram>**_

Motivation::

_<text explanation>_


Contained Building Blocks::
_<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>_

Important Interfaces::
_<Description of important interfaces>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****


==== <Name black box 1>

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

_<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_




==== <Name black box 2>

_<black box template>_

==== <Name black box n>

_<black box template>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>



=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box _<building block 1>_

...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.

=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
