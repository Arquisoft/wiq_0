“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

=== Technical Risks
|===
| Risk | Explanation | Solution
| No knowladge of React | None member of the team has worked with React before. | Read React's documentation and search for exercises and tutorials of how to use the technology.
| Github | Most of us have use it, however, some have not in a project of that magnitude. Also there are some new features for everyone. | Transfer the knowladge of essential operations in Github from those who now them to those who don't, as well as search information about how to use the new features for everyone.
| Lost of team members | Any member could leave the project due to personal reasons. Risk that gets importance if we take into account we only are four members. | Don't make any member categorically essential, so we can avoid any part of the project from being orphaned.
| External dependencies | As the app will be deployed on an external server, there could be a situation where we can not deployed it due to an external issue | Have a second deployment server in order to replace the first if it is not available.
| Insufficient tests | The lack of tests could trigger the release of some features with a not expected behaviour | Make exhaustive tests on all the features that will be released  on the app
